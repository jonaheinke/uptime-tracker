# uptime-tracker

This program tracks the uptime of a server or PC and saves it to a local file. Its path can be defined in the eighth line of the script.

If you want to bundle this program into an executable, just run `build` in the root directory. It uses [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/) to create a single executable file.
